## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is helping businesses to 
integrate and having a advantage of reusable software components.
Also to create a business applications or interface, and to provide the customer with the best service. 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-*Standardized Service Contracts- this characteristic use to standard and easy to understand the service contracts. Also to express and guarantee the purpose and capabilities. Limiting the unnecessary negotiation.

*Loose Coupling - simply removing the dependencies. It is like choosing the best choice of concept. 

*Abstraction - This characteristic teaching a independently and removing the unnecessary service infomation. 

*Service Reusability - So this is the ideal components that should be easy to reuse. That are Autonomy,Statelessness,Discoverability,Composability and Interoperability.
 
3. Define Microservices.
-Microservices, it is typically use to build an individual applications. Beacuse of it the teams can update code easily. They call it microservices because each function of the application operates as an independent service.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-it improved the scalability of the service. Also you can easily update the code to reuse and faster performance. And can use a diffenerent stacks for different component. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-SOA and Microservice are both improving services and can have the reusable software. Microservice can easily update and reuse the service or software.While SOA is standardized the service contracts and limiting the unnecessary negotiation. But this components and functions are depending on what specific organizational need or project requirements.

6. Define Web Services.

-Web Services for me is like when I'm using the website/chrome and searching a information its like requesting a answer or the information I need and then the web or the chrome will give me a information. Client to server then server to client. A communication between the user and the website.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.

*Exposing the Existing Function on the Network - using HTTP you can revoke or activate the requests. 
*Interoperability - it can share data and services. That service Interoperability objectives are to give a consistent and starting with one designing application and then onto the next.
*Standardized Protocol - so it is the desingn of UI that user will see for all layers that are service description, and service discovery layers.
*Low Cost Communication - It can rely on transport mechanisms like ftp. Also low cost on internet for implementing services. 

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
*XML-Based - It is the representation of transprtation layers. It is the design for UI or for people. 

*Loosely Coupled - it reducing the change of interface by one by one. And if the one is updating the ther interace must updating too.

*Coarse-Grained -  I think this charateristic must need a person or you should be knowledgeable in web service and right amount for business logic. 

*Ability to be Synchronous as Asynchronous - for synchronous is only for invoke and completing first the the operation before it runs, while asynchrous is allowing the cliet to execute the program. 

*Support Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) - for me it is the full force like you can invoke for the inputs and output it like giving you the full request to add.

*Support Document Exchange - So it sipport you to exchange the documents to facilitate and integrate. 

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.


*Provider - It like the programmer who gives what client wants. 
*Requestor - It is the client who request to programmer. 
*Broker - It enables the topic for the client to see the application.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

*SOAP(Single Object Access Protocol) - So it is the way or process to how to send a message protocol to enables communication. And to transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS. 

*WSDL (Web services Description Language) - This specify the location of the service or navigate the individuals to access the service. 

*UUDI (Universal Description,Discovery and Integration) - It describe the SOAP and WDSL interfaces to web services. To publish and providing more web-based serviec information.
